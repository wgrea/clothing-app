<!-- I want users to be able to find their style, know where they can wear what is appealing to them, when they can wear it so it is not as much of a one-time use. Find better weekly use clothing. Find good brands, find trending items, see how the item has evolved, compare and contrast fabrics. -->

<!-- later, I want to add what fabric to wear when I travel to a particular country. This may be an overlap with the travel app I already have -->
